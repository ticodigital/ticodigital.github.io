                    <p style="text-align: justify;">This project utilized Python libraries to build a model for predicting residential property values. Leveraging a dataset of 80 features for 100 houses, the goal was to achieve an R-squared score exceeding 80%. The project explored data cleaning, feature engineering (including one-hot encoding for categorical features), and correlation analysis to identify key influencing factors.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Multiple linear regression models were built and compared, with the best model achieving an R-squared score of 96.2%. This champion model incorporated top positive and negative correlations alongside one-hot encoded categorical variables. Notably, including categorical features yielded stronger correlations than solely using numeric variables. A crucial challenge involved selecting features with no missing values in the test data, as linear regression cannot handle them. This project demonstrates the potential of linear regression for accurate house price prediction, emphasizing the importance of data preparation and feature selection in achieving optimal results.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">This project aimed to extract insights from a complex, multi-sheet Excel file using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and analysis techniques in one integrated ETL and analysis process in Python code. Data was loaded into a MySQL database and analyzed to identify business resilience during global events like COVID-19 and the 2008 financial crisis, understand seasonal trends across different business lines, and uncover relationships between businesses.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The project employed pandas for data manipulation, SQLAlchemy for database interaction, and the MySQL connector for database access. Key findings included the identification of resilient and vulnerable business lines, the presence of seasonality within specific sectors, and potential relationships among businesses. These insights can inform strategic decision-making and risk mitigation strategies.</p>
