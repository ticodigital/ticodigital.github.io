                    <h2>Housing Price Linear Predictor</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">This project utilized Python libraries to build a model for predicting residential property values. Leveraging a dataset of 80 features for 100 houses, the goal was to achieve an R-squared score exceeding 80%. The project explored data cleaning, feature engineering (including one-hot encoding for categorical features), and correlation analysis to identify key influencing factors.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Multiple linear regression models were built and compared, with the best model achieving an R-squared score of 96.2%. This champion model incorporated top positive and negative correlations alongside one-hot encoded categorical variables. Notably, including categorical features yielded stronger correlations than solely using numeric variables.
A crucial challenge involved selecting features with no missing values in the test data, as linear regression cannot handle them. This project demonstrates the potential of linear regression for accurate house price prediction, emphasizing the importance of data preparation and feature selection in achieving optimal results.</p>
